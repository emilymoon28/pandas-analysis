# pandas-analysis

The sample data captured 780 transactions by an online gaming company. 576 unique players and 179 unique items were included in the dataset. 

The raw data were analyzed from 3 different angles: players' gender, players' age group, and purchased items. Purchase count, total purchase value, and average purchase price were the main KPIs in each angle.

Some findings and summaries are presented at the beginning of the HeroesOfPymoli_main.ipynb file.
